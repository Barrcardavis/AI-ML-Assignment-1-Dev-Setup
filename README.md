Assignment: Development Environment Setup and Data Exploration
## Project Overview  
This assignment explores the Iris dataset using Python tools.  
## Environment Details  
- Python 3.11.13  
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn 1.3.1
## Visualizations with Key insights
### 1. Histogram of Petal Length  - two major groupings, highest in 1 to 2 cm's in the data. other length lower volumes with average 4 to 6 cms
### 2. Box Plot of Sepal Width  two species seem to have similiar lengths in common, but not the third
### 3. Scatter Plot of Petal vs Width - this shows a good grouping
 
## Petal length and width show strong species separation.
